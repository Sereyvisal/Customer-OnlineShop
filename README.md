# Getting Started with Project

## Project Info
- [Design File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ca6pQ-ZEt6tTX6m9RYLiPTiNL1Os-4Iz/view)
- [Project Note](https://www.notion.so/teachhay/Company-Profile-e6ec77b560df4e199230469cd1dd6c2a)
- [Management Board](https://www.notion.so/teachhay/8a1400da61e64bedaedaf69fc6b74507?v=763d0161546b4c0faed7e6a2adadfb4a)

## Note
Add localization for each section, check-in each section for comments on how to, make sure to add new data into its correct place

Anything in the root folder of components is for general use only, put each component into its section folder
 
Separate each part into small components then combine them in the view page for that section, (make reusable components instead of hard code)
 
Make sure all pages look nice all on forms (Desktop, Mobile, Tablets)
 
Code Smart, Not Hard
 
Will add support dark mode (later after finish the first version first, so keep that into consideration)
 
Don't have to follow the design file 1:1, add your taste as you see fit

``"The only limit is your imagination"``

When committing to GitHub, make sure to put meaningful commit name and provide some description too, (if nothing to add in a description, can put the same as commit name)

When calling import from view, components etc...., you can just call the main folder directly without ``"./views"``. just use ``"views/name" or "components/name"``
